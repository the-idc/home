The G7 should be abolished - global south is the economic pole of the world
Financialized economies are eroding real wages and fuelling super-exploitation 
B3W program being a bust bc debt and short term lending

Chinese no longer remain silent when criticized, push back against western hegemony
Chinese patient capital enables countries to close infrastructure gap without ceding sovereignty and/or instigating a deterioration in the condition of ordinary people/working class

China, Vietnam, Cuba, Laos, Nicaragua, Russia, Iran, Venezuela and their responses to the pandemic offer a powerful affirmation of a culture of collective action, inclusive nationalism and public ownership of the means of production, in spite of the manufactured crises and aggression they have faced at the hands of the US lead empire

How does the empire work? US prints currency to finance its deficits, effectively exporting inflation to countries which export to the US (the global south) which must then devalue their currency in order to keep their exports competitive, reducing real wages.

South Africa, India and (I think?) South Korea were at the G7? Australia too

Another week, another  

What does the future look like for the ‘Empire of Chaos’? The recent flurry of meetings amongst the transatlantic powers in Europe was a pivotal moment, articulating what the path forward would be for the ailing “rules based order”, its traditional managers smarting from the twin traumas of Donald Trump and Brexit, enveloped by ever-simmering social crisis at the hands of a financialized economy whose depredations continue to linger more than a decade on from the 2008 crash. 

And while the US liberal commentariat’s eager, habitual indulgence in crude russophobia meant that the US-Russia summit served as a domestic backdrop of sorts for Joe Biden’s widely anticipated European tour, the President’s agenda (two days before heading to Geneva for his meeting with Putin, Biden held court with NATO allies in Brussels) made it clear that this extended visit was aimed at reasserting American control over a disoriented transatlantic alliance.

After all, it was during his first State of the Union address back in April that Biden outlined his vision for restored American leadership at home and on the world stage, predicated upon a commitment to principles of justice, fairness and human rights within the framework of a more compassionate capitalism, the means through which the United States would “win the 21st century.” 

That this decidedly unimaginative rhetoric was nonetheless enough for the usual coastal media sycophants to dub Joe “nothing will fundamentally change” Biden a [worthy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/12/opinion/biden-fdr-new-deal.html) successor to FDR speaks to the cynical calculus of those backing what journalist Pepe Escobar refers to as Obama-Biden 3.0, a hollow vessel for elite interests and a beacon to any opportunist who wishes to eke out a career for themselves in the [Social-Industrial](https://archive.org/details/TheSocial-industrialComplex/page/n3/mode/2up) complex. At best, what Biden has offered the American people and the western world writ large is further public expenditure on what can be best described as [the wages of war](https://journals.openedition.org/lisa/5371?lang=en). After all, there is a reason why many have called the military, an instrument of imperial domination, the most socialistic organization in America.

But what of Biden’s long-heralded shift left, toward policies which could at least be considered social democratic in nature? Those who still held out in the hope that the tireless campaigning on behalf of the Democrats by ordinary people across the country would be rewarded with a bonafide redistributive agenda for the working class didn’t have to wait long for their hopes to be dashed. The $15 minimum wage increase? Gone. Debt relief of any kind? Non-starter. Border camps have merely been rebranded, continuing to hold thousands in squalid conditions. And despite Democratic majorities in Congress and the support of a significant majority of Americans, there remains no momentum in Washington for any form of universal healthcare coverage. 

And while structural reforms of political economy were always a longshot, the pace with which the nascent Biden administration has moved to strengthen the grip of oligarchs on all aspects of American life should alarm progressives. The election hadn’t even happened yet when a fracking ban was taken off the table by the Biden-Harris ticket, and yet now in the midst of a historic heat wave that has suddenly made the costs of inaction on climate change frighteningly real for millions, they sound the alarm in a cynical bid to [greenwash](https://monthlyreview.org/2008/11/01/capitalist-and-socialist-responses-to-the-ecological-crisis/) the efforts of America’s biggest corporations and hedge funds to cash in on an unfurling climate disaster that is already proving to be a catastrophe for the working classes at home and abroad. 

But it is Biden’s signature “progressive” proposals concerning tax reform that most clearly illustrate what any observers concerned with fairness and social justice can expect from American leadership of the world system. Central to Biden’s plan is the negotiation with OECD countries of an agreement to implement global tax rules which include a proposed 15% global corporate income tax, as well as other regulations meant to curb tax evasion. And yet, a complete exemption has already been [carved out for financial services](https://www.ft.com/content/f10b3e92-03e9-402b-9462-237f53b4d140), a sector which has facilitated the flow into overseas tax shelters of enormous sums of wealth [totalling an estimated $5.6 trillion](https://thetricontinental.org/working-document-1/) - equivalent to about 10% of global GDP. And domestically, it should be said that his much-celebrated “rolling back” of the Trump tax cuts (a giveaway to the rich of historic proportions) only brings the corporate tax rate to 28%, well short of the 35% pre-Trump rate. Of course all of this does little to address the long-running reality that [few profitable multinationals pay anything](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/05/corporations-federal-taxes/) close to the nominal income tax rate.    

Rather than seeking “a fair deal” for the working class, the Biden administration’s agenda should be understood by progressives as the American plutocracy closing ranks against the threat posed to their rule by a coalescent populist left as well as the ascendent quasi-fascism represented by Donald Trump. 

It is no secret that Biden’s administration, chock-full of Silicon Valley executives, K Street lobbyists, and Clintonite war hawks, came to power with the [backing](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/17/902626429/wall-streets-big-money-is-betting-on-biden-and-democrats-in-2020) of much of the capitalist class. They have pitched themselves as staid imperial managers who, much like Obama once did, seek to cloak the United States’ nakedly exploitative “rules based order” with a veneer of humanitarianism and sustainability. And what project for humanity is this order supposed to protect? Confronted with a declining rate of profit, for the past five decades the oligarchy has sought to [tighten its grip on property of all kinds](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4394763) in order to further destabilize the power of labour. In this latest crisis of capitalism, the necessity of disruptions grows only more acute.

It is primarily this agenda that fuels the imperial ambitions of the G7. And it is what makes the emerging multipolar order the most important development of the previous decade. While never to be underestimated, the empire has been dealt important setbacks in many areas of strategic importance. 

 Despite aggressive US coercion in Latin America, the leftist axis of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua has been joined by people’s governments in Bolivia, Chile and soon likely in Brazil. In Asia, the world’s largest free trade deal was [signed](http://www.china.org.cn/world/2021-06/26/content_77589219.htm) without US participation, while including close US proxies like Japan and Singapore. The EU-US united front on Russia seems to be cracking, with Germany and France visibly chafing at the self-defeating policy of isolating the country. And in Africa, the enduring memory of Libya ensures that NATO militarism will continue to face stiff resistance from people's movements. 

The begrudging concession of the US on the question of vaccine patent waivers (while insisting on a plodding, bureaucratic process for doing so) reflects the growing capacity of oppressed peoples to resist, and so does the declining share of US dollar denominated trade in international commerce. And so even as the west becomes more transparently authoritarian in some respects, our movements here in the imperial core must seize on the space created by this emerging axis of resistance in the global south.  And in order to help those fighting subjugation at the hands of western imperialism, first we must accelerate ongoing efforts to organize mass movements capable of demonstrating resilient leadership in face of the present (and future) crises. 

As youth now clamour for leadership of a western left that for 30 years embraced defeat, the multipolar world and its attendant possibilities await.
