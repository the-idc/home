# JI Newsletter 2021-05-01

Welcome to the May issue of the Justice Internationale newsletter. Justice Internationale would like to condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the fact that we were not invited to be founding members of the European Super League.

In this issue of the newsletter; Loljapes covers Courage Coalition's organizing at the NDP federal convention. Sameer Gupta writes about the failings of the latest federal budget and Yogthos explains why Doug Ford is finding it so hard to grant paid sick leave in Ontario.
