# IDC Newsletter 2020-07-01

Welcome the inaugural IDC newsletter. In this issue we have two articles responding to the wave of protests that have been triggered by the killing of George Floyd. 'Yes, Canada is racist too' explores the history of discrimination against people of color in Canada while 'How to protest safely' gives some tips for people thinking about participating in protests themselves.

We also have two articles reflecting on what the ongoing COVID crisis means for Canada and the world. 'Means-testing is mean' critiques the Canadian government's obsession with limiting access to emergency response benefits while 'Work in the age of pandemic' reflects on the elements of work that are truly essential, and what elements COVID has shown we can discard.

If these topics interest you, check out 'What is the IDC?' to learn more about our organization and ways you can get involved.
