# IDC Newsletter 2020-08-01

In this issue of the IDC Newsletter we have three articles. The first, "Sorry, Not Sorry" by Loljapes, looks at Justin Trudeau's definitively Canadian habit
of responding to (most) scandals by apologizing without ever actually following through on correcting his behaviour. The second, "The Problem with Job Creators"
by Yogthos, breaks down the myth that the rich are necessary because they provide people with jobs. Last of all we have an interview with lotuswrench, the creator
of [@canadapoast](https://www.instagram.com/canadapoast/) and the Woorker series of memes that the IDC has been posting around in order to try and push workers to think about unionizing. Lotus offered some valuable insight into the mechanics and mindset of producing content for the internet.
