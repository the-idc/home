# JI Newsletter 2021-01-01

Welcome to the January issue of the Justice Internationale newsletter. It's nice to have all that over with.

In this issue of the newsletter; Jonkle interviews Gaelan Ash about his work organising as a union salt. Ryan Kolman writes about the current eviction crisis in Canada and those organising the fight against it. Ccarla muses about why AirBnB won't die. Yogthos writes about how the bailout for corporations hit different to the one for people and Loljapes tries to figure out what exactly the new leader of the Conservatives is up to.
