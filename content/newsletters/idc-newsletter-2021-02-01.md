# JI Newsletter 2021-02-01

Welcome to the February issue of the Justice Internationale newsletter. This is the closest to the deadline I've ever come so I don't have time to think up a joke for this bit.

In this issue of the newsletter; Yogthos writes about the occupation of the US capitol in January and looks for parallel movements in Canadian politics while Loljapes covers legal action in India brought by scientific publishers (who are bad) against Sci-Hub and Library Genesis (who are good).
