# Patently absurd: IP in the age of COVID

Around a year ago, Western countries started coming to the icy realization that the COVID-19 outbreak would not be contained in Asia and had in fact likely already gone pandemic within their own borders. In response, governments around the world began the age-old practice of throwing money at the problem. One of the more productive exercises in money-flinging has been the creation of several vaccines against COVID-19[^fn1].

There is a lot that is admirable in how governments supported vaccine production. No-one knew a year ago what vaccines would be most effective against COVID, so it made sense to fund multiple candidates. Similarly, it would have been tragic to have had a viable vaccine but not have the manufacturing base necessary to create the vaccine in the amounts needed, so ramping up production capacity before clinical trials were concluded also made sense. My hope is that one of the silver linings from the pandemic will be that we'll learn something about how to direct an economy according human need as opposed to raw profit motive. 

However, the decision to allow pharmaceutical companies to retain the intellectual property rights to the vaccines that have been produced is truly absurd. The usual story told about pharmaceutical patent rights is that companies take on large risks during drug research and unless the government grants them a time-limited monopoly in the form of a patent they will have no incentive to continue their work. Even before the pandemic this argument had certain flaws, but the support provided to vaccine companies during the pandemic completely destroys it. Several vaccine companies were given billions of dollars, completely risk-free, in order to let them create their COVID-19 vaccines. Even if the IP rights for COVID vaccines were put in the public domain, the companies that developed the vaccines would have huge advantages over competitors due to the institutional scientific and logistical knowledge they've built over the past year, all of which was paid for with public money. And the support for vaccine companies doesn't end at the financial help that was given, governments around the world undertook other activities such as speeding up regulatory processes. This was likely especially helpful for the vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech as they use mRNA technology which hadn't been used previously in vaccines and would likely have faced extra scrutiny. You literally can't buy the sort of support that was given by governments in order to speed up vaccine production. 

There are some signs that vaccine companies know they're in a delicate situation. Moderna has made a pledge to not enforce intellectual property restrictions on its vaccine until the pandemic is over (other companies have been more tight lipped, and even Moderna's pledge gives them a big loophole to start charging once the pandemic is over). However, the problem is that these companies retain any rights at all to technology that wouldn't have been developed without huge influxes of public cash. Western countries have put themselves in the position of paying once to build up manufacturing and research capacity for private companies, then paying again to take delivery of the product of that investment. 

Although Canada has already signed contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars with vaccine producers in the last year, it appears to be willing to go even further to defend the profits of pharmaceutical companies. In October 2020, India and South Africa submitted a request to the World Trade Organization for a [time-limited waiver of intellectual property restrictions](https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/IP/C/W669.pdf&Open=True) on healthcare technologies related to the COVID pandemic[^fn2]. The proposal is supported by around 70 countries, but Canada in not one of them, and has released a statement saying that they see no problems with the current international IP regime. Because of its wealth, Canada has been able to secure enough vaccine shots to treat every Canadian eight times over, by opposing the TRIPS waiver it lets the rest of the world know that if they want the same security, they'll have to pay too.

[^fn1]: According to the WHO there are currently [182 vaccines in preclinical testing and 74 in clinical trials](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines)
[^fn2]: The move isn't completely disinterested, India in particular has a huge generics industry which would love to be able to produce vaccines and medical technology license-free.
