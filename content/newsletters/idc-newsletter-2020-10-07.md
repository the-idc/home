# IDC Newsletter 2020-10-07

Welcome to the October issue of the IDC newsletter. We missed the usual first-day-of-the-month publication date for this issue because we wanted to report on an IDC event that took place last weekend. The Super Dialectacular Spectacular was a two-day conference where various Canadian lefties made a case for the issue they see as most important for the left to be working on. You can watch all the presentations from the conference [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQgLTo9TA3IM1fBfk-eWGfw/videos?app=desktop) (or read our summaries below) and vote for the ideas you like best [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYHZ68upS4-Swu4CIXmn2apNKnWwytI6R8K5PEBYfXUvUIsA/viewform) (there are prizes). We also have newsletter contributions from Jonkle and Loljapes.
