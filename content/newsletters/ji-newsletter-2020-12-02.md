# JI Newsletter 2020-12-02

Welcome to the December issue of the Justice Internationale newsletter. We're not the IDC anymore! The name change was the result of a bloody internecine struggle between warring tendencies within the IDC. The losing side has been punished by being made responsible for the newsletter.

In this issue of the newsletter, Yogthos writes about the importance of the left owning its own online tools while Jonkle and Loljapes give their impressions of a panel discussion run by the Society for Socialist Studies which had the theme '*After the US election, challenges and possibilities for the Left*'.
