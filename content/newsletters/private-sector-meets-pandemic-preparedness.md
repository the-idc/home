Canada is struggling to secure COVID-19 vaccines and has now even \[dipped into a fund for the developing nations](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-canada-the-only-g7-country-to-take-vaccines-from-fund-for-developing/). Not only that, but there does not appear to be a good distribution strategy in order to deliver the vaccines that we have available. Even \[US is vastly outpacing](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/u-s-vaccine-rollout-vastly-outpacing-canada-s-what-can-we-learn-from-american-push-1.5317867) Canada in their vaccine distribution effort. Canada is now in the \[20th place](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-20-world-vaccine-doses-administered-1.5891465) globally.

It's worth asking how Canada ended up in a situation where Canada is not able to produce its own vaccines, and why we had such poor pandemic preparedness overall. All of this contributed to creating the situation we are in now.

Turns out that privatization was one major factor in this equation. Harper led conservative government chose to \[dismantle](https://www.thespec.com/opinion/contributors/2020/11/29/here-is-why-we-dont-have-vaccine-production-capacity-in-canada.html) our national vaccine production capacity and let the private sector handle it. However, the problem with the private sector is that it's primarily driven by profit incentives. Unfortunately there is no profit in investing effort into something that may happen sometime in an undefined future. Businesses must invest their effort into actions that produce immediate and consistent profit or risk becoming bankrupt. 

Furthermore, large corporations have a responsibility to their shareholder to demonstrate consistent profit. Once again this incentive is at odds with spending time producing something that has no clear and immediate benefit. Incidentally, this is also why we did not have sufficient PPE at the start of the pandemic or the necessary testing capacity.

In general, the goal of generating continuous profit is directly at odds with the goal of having a robust system. Robustness requires having buffers and planning for the unexpected. However, these buffers are seen as inefficiency from the profit perspective. This is one of the factors leading to recurring economic crashes in capitalist economies.

Since the system operates on thin margins it has difficulties adapting to rapid changes in the environment. This problem is further exacerbated by globalization that resulted in local production being replaced by complex and fragile global supply chains.

What the pandemic is teaching us is that capitalist incentives are not compatible with having a robust and stable economy. Especially when it comes to providing for the essential needs of the public. We're clearly seeing that the profit motive is not aligned with our welbeing and does not serve the interest of the majority.

Canada must learn from this pandemic and ensure that we are much better prepared to handle the next disaster whatever it may be. We don't know when it will happen, or what shape it will take, but we can be certain that it will come at some point.

The solution is to create national capacity to ensure that the necessities are available regardless of whether it's profitable to do so or not. Traditionally this has been achieved by growing the public sector. Not only does this approach allow solving problems that are not profitable to solve, but it also has a number of other benefits.

Public sector can be used as a tool to provide employment and guarantee that anybody who wants to work has a job. and it ensures a robust local industry that will not be outsourced to other countries.

As the immediate lesson from the pandemic, Canada needs to rebuild its public medical research capacity instead of continuing to rely on the whims of the private sector. This includes vaccine capacity, pharmacare, and any other medical research.
